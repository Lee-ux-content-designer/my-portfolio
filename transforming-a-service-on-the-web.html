<h2>In summary: re-designing a service's content</h2>

<p>The local authority Dorset Council's goal was to help more people and families needing care online. They hired me for 1 year to re-design 250 pages of adult care content. My user research into people's journeys into the care system informed a transformation of how the content was organised and presented.</p>

<h2>How I found out about service users' needs</h2>

<p>To uncover the needs of people requiring any help to look after themselves, I carried out primary research.</p>
<p>I requested to listen to people calling the service to find out about how they think about their needs and what we offer. I decided this because Dorset Council had no user researchers and my desktop research only told me about people already accessing services.</p>
<p>I found out from listening to new and prospective service users that many avoided contacting us until their care needs were great. I learnt that even when people tried to get our advice on our <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210629103818/https:/adultsocialcare.dorsetcouncil.gov.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">existing site</a>, they found it difficult to understand what could help.</p>

<p> I saw an opportunity to make it easier for people to access activities, advice and equipment.</p>

<h2>How I found out what content was useful and was missing</h2>

<p>To recommend how we might reorganise the content, I carried out a content audit and mapped this published information to the needs I had uncovered.</p>
<p>I firstly looked at the needs prospective and potential service users reported, and identified patterns. These formed stages in a journey to becoming a care service user, including 'denying needing help,' a trigger and a resulting 'new life situation'.</p>
<p>Next, I placed the sections and pages of content at the stages in a journey into the service at the points when they might help. I soon saw that at some stages, content was overwhelming; at others, there were content gaps.</p>

<h2>How I designed content to reflect people's needs</h2>

<p>I made the case for change to the heads of the care service by presenting my findings on where we were over- or under-providing information, alongside analytics reinforcing my argument.</p>
<p>I set out a plan for re-designing, removing or adding to content in xx new navigation sections corresponding to the journey to becoming a service user. I won their support for my recommended new site structure, and they requested for the relevant subject experts to work with me to develop the content.</p>
<p>So I proceeded to pair-write to design content without source information wherever possible, and produced the new site before my 1-year contract was completed.</p>
