<h2>In summary: winning business for a new venture</h2>

<p>The new consultancy Southampton Geospatial tasked me with developing a new website section for potential clients. In response, I defined both the venture's services and how we might allow visitors to engage with these.</p>

<p> 
        <img src="path/to/.defining-business-services.png" alt="A screenshot of the content outlining some services that the venture, Southampton Geospatial, provides. This includes clear subheadings for each service over 2 or 3 lines, allowing users to see at a glance what the services are and what they help with. For example, 'Get models and analysis to combine and interpret data'"</p>

<h2>My approach to developing the content</h2>

<p>To develop the content, I:

• facilitated a workshop to identify service users
• defined and prioritised a range of services
• sketched a new pattern to offer services
• gained agreement for the approach</P>

<h2>How I won stakeholder support for defining services</h2>

<p>With colleagues, I focused the business stakeholders on meeting the needs of a range of potential industry clients.</p>
<p>I planned and facilitated exercises to gather information on their business goals in a shared workspace. This allowed me to build their understanding that target service users were not experts and would need content on what problems geospatial services could help them with. </p>
<p>I reported back on the workshop findings and gave recommendations on how we might meet visitor needs and clearly communicate the value proposition, focusing on what problems they could help with. The outcome: an agreement we would focus on applications, and not processes, and use frequently used words.</p>

<h2>How I finalised the content to outline the services</h2>

<p>I prioritised service descriptions with the stakeholders in the first iteration of a new service offering content type.</p>
<p>I convinced them:
• arrange photographs of the experts undertaking activity, as opposed to abstract imagery
• to accept this content type having clearer, less concise headings so that visitors could see the offering at a glance
• to accept fewer words in the overview of their services by showing how it would look when magnifying a screen or on a smaller screen</p>
<p>The outcome: I published content useful for prospective clients with stakeholder support. My recommendation to make the overview more concise paid off, with heatmap data showing average visitors scrolling deeper into the content.</p>
