        <h2>My projects</h2>
        <p>I make sense of information and how people understand it so that users can make progress. I work at both the domain and interaction levels, researching entities and needs, and designing how to best represent and facilitate these.</p>

                <h3>Investigating a domain to make news content more impactful</h3>
                <p>News publishers at a University wanted their news items to get more attention. So I discovered business and user goals that news could support, mapping the domain to find what entities news could best connect users with, and obtained data on where we might do this in user journeys.</p>

                <h3>Transforming how a service is provided online</h3>
                <p>My user research into people's journeys into the care system informed a new site structure and new and replacement content. The navigation corresponded to stages in people's journeys and the needs I'd discovered they felt at each stage. Stakeholders accepted my proposals to reduce over 250 pages to a few dozen and to developing content through pair-writing.</p>

                <h3>Defining services and a content pattern for a new venture</h3>
                <p>I developed a new website section for business venture Southampton Geospatial by facilitating workshops to identify potential users and services that might help them. This informed my work to define and prioritise service offerings, communicated in accessible language and patterns that I won the business's support for.</p>
