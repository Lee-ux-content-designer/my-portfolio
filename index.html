        <h2>My projects</h2>
        <p>I make sense of information and how people understand it so that users can make progress. I work at both the domain and interaction levels, researching entities and needs, and designing how to best represent and facilitate these.</p>

                <h3>Discovering missing and disconnected domain entities to meet business goals</h3>
                <p>News publishers at a university wanted their news items to get more visits. So I firstly discovered their ultimate goals, then set out to find how news content might help to achieve these.</p>
                <p>I mapped the subject domain to find which entities news could best connect users with, and obtained data on where we might do this in user journeys.</p>

                <h3>Developing a new information architecture to transform a service</h3>
                <p>My user research into people's journeys into the care system informed a new site structure and new and replacement content.</p>
                <p>The navigation corresponded to stages in people's journeys and the needs I'd discovered they felt at each stage. Stakeholders accepted my proposals to reduce over 250 pages to a few dozen and to developing content through pair-writing.</p>

                <h3>Defining business services and designing content to launch a venture</h3>
                <p>I developed a new website section for business venture Southampton Geospatial.</p>
<p>I facilitated workshops to identify potential users and services that might help them. This informed my work to define and prioritise service offerings, communicated in clear, accessible language and patterns that I won the business's support for.</p>

                <h3>Re-designing and testing the form for a Government department's publication process</h3>
                <p>I re-designed a Government web content request form.</p>
<p>I discovered what was important for service providers and users, tested the revised form's usability, iterated and re-tested. The result: the removal of pain points for the service users, and better data for the service providers.</p>
