<h2>Improving a content process for a Government department</h2>
        <h3>In summary</h3>
	<pI re-designed a Government web content request form by discovering what was important for service providers and users, testing the revised form's usability, and iterating.</p>

	<h3>The issue with the service I set out to improve</h3>	
	<p>The department's Digital team was migrating its service request form to another platform. So we took an opportunity to identify any pain points for users and potentially make improvements to information they received so that requests were easier to act upon. The Head of Content Design asked me to lead on overseeing the user experience.</p>

	<h3>How I discovered the information to collect</h3>
	<p>To improve the form, I first contacted colleagues receiving requests. This included both those responding to publication requests, and another team asking for information about potential media interest in publications. My aim was to find out what information was essential.</p>
	<p>I found out from talking to service providers that the current form often led to a lack of necessary information for the service. This included on the rationale for publishing new or substantially revised content, and meant lengthy email chains for the team to find out more.</p>

	<h3>How I re-designed the form for submitting requests</h3>
	<p>I carried out a content audit and heuristic evaluation of the form to map what was necessary and where there were potential issues. This informed my first re-organisation of the structure, new headings, questions, field labels, tooltips and button labels.</p> 
	<p>The re-design was aimed at easing the time colleagues were investing in the form and minimising usability issues such as a reliance on recall and a potential lack of familiarity with form terms.</p>
	<p>Next, I asked service users to test out their usability while I observed, both in-person and remotely. I took notes on the 6 participants carrying out 3 tasks using the app a developer had created:
<ul>
	   <li>to request content</li>
           <li>review a request</li>
           <li>edit a request</li>
</ul>

        <h3>How my analysis of usability tests led to changes</h3>
        <p>I analysed the research notes to find patterns in pain points, both those I observed participants experiencing and those participants reported when I asked exploratory questions. These ranged from hesitation over questions and misinterpreting fields to a complete loss of entered data due to a user interface label.</p>
        <p>The findings led me to making recommendations to publications colleagues and the Head of Content Design. I recommended that we:<ul> 
          <li>introduce a branching question so irrelevant questions were not asked</li>
	  <li>remove questions where there was some overlap with others</li>
	  
	  <li>make buttons clearer to reduce errors</li>
        </ul></p>
 
	<h3>How I confirmed the improvements in the iteration</h3>
	<p>I socialised my recommendations and the evidence for them with teams, to win their support for adding and removing questions. This included the major change of 2 separate branches for publication and content design requests.</p>
	<p>I tested the second iteration with requestors to satisfy the team that these changes to the service would be efficient for both those making and receiving the requests. The result was a form that provided both a better experience and better information.</p>
