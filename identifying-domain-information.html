<h2>Identifying domain information to make news content useful and impactful</h2>

    <main>
        <h3>In summary</h2>
        <p>News publishers at a University wanted their news items to be easier to find. So I discovered business and user goals that news could support, mapping the domain to find what entities news could best connect users with, and obtained data on where we might do this in user journeys.</p>

        <!-- More detailed content here -->
        
        <h2>My approach to identifying the information architecture</h2>
        <p>To identify where to place different types of news, I:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>conducted a news content audit to discover entities they might connect to</li>
            <li>mapped the subject domain and prioritised the organisation's entities</li>
            <li>asked an analyst to find where users look for priority entities</li>
            <li>recommended how news might focus in a new content type</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>How I discovered what the organisation's news focuses on</h3>
        <p>To understand the organisation's priorities for news, I helped to chair a workshop to ask stakeholders. I followed this with a content audit to get quantitative data on this too.</p>
        <p>My fellow facilitators and I asked stakeholders about their motivations and goals for publishing news and helped to synthesise the findings. A big priority was to publish news so that the University could connect with external people.</p>
        <p>My content audit was at the same time uncovering the types of people and other entities news mentions and could help visitors to news to connect with. The outcome: I narrowed my focus to priority people, and entities such as research facilities.</p>
        
        <h3>How I developed a case for representing entities in the content</h3>
        <p>To gain a bigger understanding of the entities, I analysed instances of news content in greater depth and asked an analyst for how they are found.</p>
        <p>I analysed instances of news to find the opportunities. I found it could benefit the organisation to better represent a research facility in an item that focused on David Attenborough, for example. I also learned that some important entities, such as 'business collaborators' were not well represented within our architecture.</p>
        <p>The outcome: I found opportunities for news to connect users with existing entities, and with those yet to be included in the architecture.</p>
        
        <h3>How I pinpointed where visitors look for the important entities</h3>
        <p>I asked an analyst to provide data on where users looked for priority entities, starting with research collaborators.</p>
        <p>I needed to know where visitors look for entities my mapping had uncovered such as research collaborators. The analyst found a large cohort of research group visitors going to 3 or more collaborator profiles, so I carried out qualitative analysis to make a hypothesis.</p>
        <p>Research collaborators were not always well represented in the architecture. News could ensure the latest roles were both represented, and connected.</p>

<h3>The outcome</h3>
        <p>The outcome: I alighted on a rationale for where both to place types of news, and what to connect it to.</p>
